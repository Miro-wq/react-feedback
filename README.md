# Feedback Widget 

## Description 
 The project demonstrates a simple feedback collection widget built with React, showcasing fundamental React concepts such as state management, event handling, and component-based architecture.

## Features 
- **Feedback Categories:** Allows users to provide feedback in three categories: "Good," "Neutral," and "Bad."
- **Dynamic Statistics:** Displays real-time statistics, including the total number of feedbacks and the percentage of positive feedback.
- **State Management:** Manages and updates feedback data using React's component state.
- **Reusable Components:** Organized and modular React components for better code maintainability.

## Technologies Used: 
- **React:** Core library for building the user interface.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** Modern features for dynamic logic.
- **CSS Modules:** Scoped styling for individual components.

## Key Objectives: 
- **State Management:** Gain experience in managing state within a React component, ensuring that the application dynamically updates based on user interactions.
- **Data Calculation:** Learn how to compute aggregate statistics, such as total feedback and the percentage of positive reviews, using helper methods.
- **Component-Based Architecture:** Practice structuring a React application by breaking down the user interface into reusable and maintainable components.
- **Conditional Rendering:** Implement conditional rendering to display content only when certain conditions are met, enhancing the user experience.
By completing this project, i've develop a solid understanding of how to build and organize a React application, focusing on state management, data computation, and UI componentization.

## Step 1 

The application should display the number of reviews collected for each category. The application should not save statistics between different sessions (page refresh).

The state of the application should have the following structure; adding new properties is not allowed:

```js
state = {
  good: 0,
  neutral: 0,
  bad: 0
}
```

## Step 2 

Extend the functionality of the application so that the interface displays more statistics about the collected reviews. Display the total number of reviews collected across all categories and the percentage of positive reviews.

To achieve this, create the helper methods `countTotalFeedback()` and `countPositiveFeedbackPercentage()`, which will calculate these values based on the state data (computed data).

## Step 3 

Refactor the application. The application's state should remain in the root component `<App>`.

Move the statistics display into a separate component `<Statistics good={} neutral={} bad={} total={} positivePercentage={}>`.  
Move the button block into the `<FeedbackOptions options={} onLeaveFeedback={}>` component.  
Create the `<Section title="">` component, which will render a section with a title and children. Add the `<Statistics>` and `<FeedbackOptions>` components to this new component.

## Step 4 

Extend the applicationâ€™s functionality so that the statistics block is only rendered after at least one piece of feedback has been collected. Move the message about the absence of statistics into the `<Notification message="There is no feedback">` component.
